Generates a PDF transcript of a given YouTube video's subtitles.

Use cases: 
- podcasts/interviews/long videos where people speak in a foreign language that you're learning.
- when you just can't be bothered to listen to a video but you're still interested in it.

Using NodeJS, Express, ReactJS, YouTube API, and a bunch of node modules.
I can not thank lodash enough.

Possible features and improvements:
- Word frequency table on PDF. (Already have the object, just not the display logic)
- Target words. (Have input of words from user, and those words will display differently, maybe coloured or bolded, on transcript)
- Timestamps on PDF
- Cleaner code
